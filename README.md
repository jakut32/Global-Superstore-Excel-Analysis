# Global Superstore Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **Global Superstore** dataset to track sales, profitability, and supply chain performance. I developed a dynamic Excel dashboard that transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights, allowing for deep-dives into regional performance and product category trends.

## 🚀 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks five essential metrics for real-time business monitoring:
* **Total Sales:** Overall revenue generated across global markets.
* **Total Customers:** The scale of the unique customer base.
* **Total Profit:** Net earnings after all costs.
* **Profit Margin (%):** Financial health and efficiency of sales.
* **Average Delivery Days:** Logistics efficiency and shipping performance.

## 📊 Dashboard Features & Visualizations
The analysis is broken down into three main categories:

### 1. Financial & Time-Series Analysis
* **Profit Over Time:** Identification of seasonal trends and growth patterns.
* **Yearly Profit:** Comparison of annual performance to track scaling.
* **Profit per Sub-Category:** Granular view of product-level profitability.

### 2. Geographic & Market Insights
* **Global Mapping:** Visual representation of **Total Profit, Sales, and Orders per Country**.
* **Market Segmentation:** Analysis of **Segment vs. Total Sales vs. Total Profit** to identify high-value customer groups.
* **Top Countries:** Ranking of sales and order volume by geographic location.

### 3. Logistics & Customer Profiling
* **Shipping Mode Analysis:** Evaluation of **Total Sales per Shipping Mode**.
* **Profitability Profiling:** A deep dive into **Customer Profile vs. Profit Margin** to understand which demographics are most lucrative.
